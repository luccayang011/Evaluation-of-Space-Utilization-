# Evaluation-of-Space-Utilization-

This comes from one of my projects. The goal is to define several key metrics to evaluate the current space utlization efficiency for warehouses. 

I used numpy & pandas to analyze the sample data at first. Once testify the success for all the calculation methods, I used PySpark to read the data from data lake, performed data transformation and output results as tables.
