# Project : Evaluation of Space Utilization Efficiency

All the sensitive information is removed from demo codes to ensure data security.

This comes from one of my projects. The goal is to define several key metrics to evaluate the current space utlization efficiency for warehouses. 

I used numpy & pandas to analyze the sample data first. Once testify the success for all the calculation methods, I used PySpark in Databricks to read the data from data lake, performed data transformation and output results as tables.
